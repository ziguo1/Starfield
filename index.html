		In the distant future, you peek into the vastness of space outside of your sleeping quarters, staring into empty
		space as stars shoot by faster than the speed of light. You fall asleep to the gentle hum of the ship's engines.<br>
		"Oddball" classes - nearby moving emissive stars, non-emissive "planets", and stationary background stars<br>
		Hold down a mouse button to enter warp speed, and hit the space bar to "stop" the spaceship. You can also pan around the camera.
